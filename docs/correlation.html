<p>The <code>chredlin</code> data set appears in the <code>faraway</code> package accompanying a book by Julian Faraway (<em>Practical Regression and Anova using R</em>, 2002.) Faraway explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In a study of insurance availability in Chicago, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights attempted to examine charges by several community organizations that insurance companies were redlining their neighborhoods, i.e. canceling policies or refusing to insure or renew. First the Illinois Department of Insurance provided the number of cancellations, non-renewals, new policies, and renewals of homeowners and residential fire insurance policies by ZIP code for the months of December 1977 through February 1978. The companies that provided this information account for more than 70% of the homeowners insurance policies written in the City of Chicago. The department also supplied the number of FAIR plan policies written an renewed in Chicago by zip code for the months of December 1977 through May 1978. Since most FAIR plan policyholders secure such coverage only after they have been rejected by the voluntary market, rather than as a result of a preference for that type of insurance, the distribution of FAIR plan policies is another measure of insurance availability in the voluntary market.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, the degree to which residents obtained FAIR policies can be seen as an indirect measure of redlining. This participation in an “involuntary” market is thought to be largely driven by rejection of coverage under more traditional insurance plans.</p>

<p>The word <em>correlation</em> describes a linear relationship between two numerical variables. As long as certain conditions are met, we can calculate a statistic called the <em>correlation coefficient</em>, often denoted with a lowercase r.</p>
<p>There are several different ways to compute a statistic that measures correlation. The most common way, and the way we will learn in this chapter, is often attributed to an English mathematician named Karl Pearson. According to his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Pearson">Wikipedia page</a>,</p>

</div>
<hr>
<p>While Pearson is often credited with its discovery, the so-called “Pearson correlation coefficient” was first developed by a French scientist, Auguste Bravais. Due to the misattribution of discovery, along with the desire to disassociate the useful tool of correlation from its problematic applications to racism and eugenics, we will just refer to it as the <em>correlation coefficient</em> (without a name attached).</p>
<p>The correlation coefficient, r, has some important properties.</p>
<ul>
<li>The correlation coefficient is a number between -1 and 1.</li>
<li>A value close to 0 indicates little or no correlation.</li>
<li>A value close to 1 indicates strong positive correlation.</li>
<li>A value close to -1 indicates strong negative correlation.</li>
</ul>
<p>In between 0 and 1 (or -1), we often use words like weak, moderately weak, moderate, and moderately strong. There are no exact cutoffs for when such words apply. You must learn from experience how to judge scatterplots and r values to make such determinations.</p>
<p>A correlation is positive when low values of one variable are associated with low values of the other value. Similarly, high values of one variable are associated with high values of the other. For example, exercise is positively correlated with burning calories. Low exercise levels will burn a few calories; high exercise levels burn more calories, on average.</p>
<p>A correlation is negative when low values of one variable are associated with high values of the other value, and vice versa. For example, tooth brushing is negatively correlated with cavities. Less tooth brushing may result in more cavities; more tooth brushing is associated with fewer calories, on average.</p>

<p>Two variables are considered “associated” any time there is any type of relationship between them (i.e., they are not independent). However, in statistics, we reserve the word “correlation” for situations meeting more stringent conditions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The two variables must be numerical.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;There are other ways of measuring association for variables that are not numerical, but these aren’t covered in this course.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a>

<li>There is a somewhat linear relationship between the variables, as shown in a scatterplot.</li>
<li>There are no serious outliers.</li>
</ol>
<p>For condition (2) above, keep in mind that real data in scatterplots very rarely lines up in a perfect straight line. Instead, you will see a “cloud” of dots. All we want to know is whether that cloud of dots mostly moves from one corner of the scatterplot to the other. Violations of this condition will usually be for one of two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dots are scattered completely randomly with no discernible pattern.</li>
<li>The dots have a pattern or shape to them, but that shape is curved and not linear.</li>

<p>When two variables are correlated—indeed, associated in any way, not just in a linear relationship—that means that there is a relationship between them. However, that does not mean that one variable <em>causes</em> the other variable.</p>
<p>For example, we discovered above that there was a moderate correlation between the racial composition of a ZIP code and the new FAIR policies created in those ZIP codes. However, being part of a racial minority does not cause someone to seek out alternative forms of insurance, at least not directly. In this case, the racial composition of certain neighborhoods, though racist policies, affected the availability of certain forms of insurance for residents in those neighborhoods. And that, in turn, caused residents to seek other forms of insurance.</p>
<p>In the Chicago example, there is still likely a causal connection between one variable (<code>race</code>) and the other (<code>involact</code>), but it was indirect. In other cases, there is no causal connection at all. Here are a few of my favorite examples.</p>

<hr>
<p>In the Chicago example, the causal effect was indirect. In the example from the exercise above, there is no causation whatsoever between the two variables. Instead, the causal effect was generated by a third factor that caused both ice cream sales to go up, and also happened to cause drowning deaths to go up. (Or, equivalently stated, it caused ice cream sales to be low during certain times of the year and also caused the drowning deaths to be low as well.) Such a factor is called a <em>lurking variable</em>. When a correlation between two variables exists due solely to the intervention of a lurking variable, that correlation is called a <em>spurious correlation</em>. The correlation is real; a scatterplot of ice cream sales and drowning deaths would show a positive relationship. But the reasons for that correlation to exist have nothing to do with any kind of direct causal link between the two.</p>

</h2>
<p>So when is a statistical finding (like correlation, for example) evidence of a causal relationship? Before we can answer that question, we need a few more definitions.</p>
<p>A lot of data comes from “observational studies” where we simply observe or measure things as they are “in the wild,” so to speak. We don’t interfere in any way. We just write down what we see. Polls are usually observational in that we ask people questions and record their responses. We do not try to manipulate their responses in any way. We just ask the questions and observe the answers. Field studies are often observational. We go out in nature and write stuff down as we observe it.</p>
<p>Another way to gather data is an <em>experiment</em>. In an experiment, we introduce a manipulation or treatment to try to ascertain its effect. For example. if we’re testing a new drug, we will likely give the drug to one group of patients and a <em>placebo</em> to the other.</p>

<p>Given what you have learned about the placebo effect, why is it important to have a placebo group in a drug trial? Why not just give one set of patients the drug and compare them to another group that takes no pill at all?</p>
<div class="answer">
<p>Please write up your answer here.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<p>The goal of the experiment is to learn whether the <em>treatment</em> (in this example, the drug) is effective when compared to the <em>control</em> (in this example, the placebo).</p>
<p>Note that the word “effective” implies a causal claim. We want to know if the drug <em>causes</em> patients to get better.</p>
<p>Unlike an observational study, in which the relationship between variables can be caused by a lurking variable, in an experiment, we purposefully manipulate one of the variables and try to control all others. For example, we manipulate the drug variable (we purposefully give some people the drug and others the placebo). But we control the amount of the drug given and the schedule on which patients are required to take the pills.</p>
<p>There are lots of things we cannot control. For example, it would be very difficult to control the diet of every person in the experiment. Could diet play a role in whether a patient gets better? Sure, so how do we know diet is not a lurking variable? In the context of an experiment, lurking variables are often called “confounders” or “confounding variables”. (The two terms are basically synonymous.)</p>
<p>One way to mitigate the effect of confounders that we cannot directly control is to <em>randomize</em> the patients into the treatment and control groups. With random selection, there will likely be people who have relatively healthy diets in both the control and treatment groups. If the drugs work, in theory they should still work better for the treatment group than for those taking the placebo. And likewise, patients with less healthy diets will generally be mixed up in both groups, and the drug should also work better for them.</p>
<p>The mantra of experimental design is, “Control as much as you can. Randomize to take care of the rest.”</p>
<p>There are lots of aspects of experimental design that we will not go into here (for example, blinding and blocking). But we will continue to mention the differences between observational studies and experiments in future chapters as we exercise caution in making causal claims.</p>

<hr>
<p>So even when there is no direct causal link between two variables, if they are positively correlated, then large values of one variable are associated with large values of the other variable. So if I tell you one value is large, it is reasonable to predict that the other value will be large as well.</p>
<p>We use the language “predictor” variable and “response” variable to reinforce this idea.</p>
<p>In a properly designed and controlled experiment, we can use different language. In this case, we can <em>explain</em> the outcome using the treatment variable. If we’ve controlled for everything else, the only possible explanation for a difference between the treatment and control groups must be the treatment variable. If the patients get better on the drug (more so than those on the placebo) and we’ve controlled for every other possible confounding variable, the only possible explanation is that the drug works. The drug “explains” the difference in the response variable.</p>
<p>Be careful, as sometimes statisticians use the term “explanatory variable” to mean any kind of variable that predicts or explains. In this course, we will try to use the term “predictor variable” exclusively.</p>

<p>If we have two numerical variables that have a linear association between them (also assuming there are no serious outliers), we can compute the correlation coefficient that measures the strength and direction of that linear association.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that in an observational study, this correlation is a measure of association, but it does not signify that one variable causes the other. It’s possible that one variable causes the other, but it’s also possible that a third “lurking” variable is responsible for the association. Either way, the fact that a relationship exists means it is possible to use values of one variable to make reasonable predictions about the values of the other variable.</p>
<p>In a properly designed experiment, the manipulation of one variable while controlling for others (and randomizing to take care of other confounders) ensures that there is a causal link between the treatment variable and the response of interest. In this case, the treatment can “explain” the response, not just predict it.</p>
