R, however, number sign indicates “comment” line. R code , line # sample R code executed R code. can clearly see two lines following executed R code. careful! Number signs inside outside R code chunks behave differently.Typically, first code chunk appears document load packages need. using package called tidyverse (really collection lots different packages) throughout course. load now. Click Run button (dark green, right-facing arrow) code chunk .output consists bunch information generated trying load package. errors, even though one section labeled “Conflicts”. Usually, errors appear word “Error”, ’s typically clear something just didn’t work. Also note ’ve loaded package, don’t need load restart R session. example, go back try run code chunk one time, output disappear. ’s tidyverse already loaded, second “run” doesn’t actually generate output anymore.Okay, let’s something interesting now. ’ll revisit penguins data set introduced previous chapter. Remember, though, data set also lives package needs loaded. Run code chunk load palmerpenguins package:Let’s see happens try run multiple commands one code chunk:’re looking RStudio, ’s bit mess. RStudio best give asked , three separate commands . first two (head tail) print data, first two boxes output tables showing head tail data. next one (str) normally just prints information Console. RStudio gave R Console box output command.look HTML file, can see situation isn’t bad. command corresponding output appear nicely separated .Nevertheless, good practice good habit get put multiple output-generating commands R code chunks. Run following code chunks compare output mess saw :won’t look different HTML file, sure looks lot cleaner RStudio.two lines first code chunk ran ?two lines separated two code chunks? run , ’ll see one piece output. ’s line test <- c(1, 2, 3, 4) works invisibly background. vector test gets assigned, output produced. Try see (push Run button):’s harm separating lines putting chunks, ’s strictly necessary. really need separate lines produce output. (even , forget, RStudio kindly give multiple boxes output.)Suppose define new variable called test2 code chunk. PURPOSES EXERCISE, HIT RUN BUTTON YET! go look HTML file.first line defines test2 invisibly. second line asks R print value test2, HTML file see output. ’s run code chunk yet. DON’T HIT RUN BUTTON YET!Okay, now go Console RStudio (lower left corner screen). Try typing test2. get “Error: object ‘test2’ found.”happen? Global Environment doesn’t know yet. Look upper right corner screen, “Environment” tab. see test, test2.Okay, NOW GO BACK CLICK RUN BUTTON LAST CHUNK . output appears RStudio code chunk Global Environment updated.take home message :sure run code chunks RStudio!RStudio, look toolbar document, toward right. see word “Run” little drop-menu next . Click drop-menu select “Run ”. see happened? code chunks ran , means anything Global Environment now updated reflect definitions made R Notebook.’s good idea “Run ” first open new R Notebook. ensure code chunks output (meaning don’t go click Run button manually chunk, one time) Global Environment accurately reflect variables using.can “Run ” time time, ’s easier just “Run ” beginning, Run individual R code chunks manually create .Now go back Environment tab find icon little broom . Click . get popup warning “remove objects environment”. Click “Yes”. Now Global Environment empty. Go back “Run” menu select “Run ”. objects defined R Notebook file back.Clearing environment can useful time time. Maybe ’ve working chapter ’ve tried bunch stuff didn’t work, went back changed bunch code. Eventually, junk accumulates Global Environment can mess R Notebook. example, let’s define variable called my_variable., let’s calculation my_variable.Perhaps later decide don’t really need my_variable. Put hashtag front code my_variable <- 42 comment longer run, don’t touch next code chunk multiply 2. Now try running code chunk my_variable * 2 . Note my_variable still sitting Global Environment, don’t get error messages. R can still see access my_variable.Now go “Run” menu select “Restart R Run Chunks”. clears Global Environment runs R code starting top R Notebook. time get error message: object 'my_variable' found. ’ve tried calculate variable called my_variable doesn’t exist anymore. (line defined commented .)’s best make sure code chunks run loaded clean R session. “Restart R Run Chunks” option easy way clear environment re-run code chunks. can often want, definitely want one last time done. end chapter, ready prepare final draft, please select “Restart R Run Chunks”.

Generally, look three things:ModesModes peaks data. places data tends cluster, representing common values numerical variable. penguin data, appears big mode 3500 4000 grams. data one clear mode, call data unimodal. data can also bimodal, generally, multimodal. often happens data contains multiple groups different . case, know three species penguin data, species drastically different body mass, might looking multimodal data. ’ll explore question later chapter. now, ’s hard say ’s going histogram lot spiky bars popping . ’s completely obvious many modes might .SymmetryIf one mode, can also ask data spread evenly left right mode. , call data symmetric. data perfectly symmetric, looking overall balance areas left right mode. data symmetric, call skewed. Assuming one big mode around 3500 4000, body mass data skewed. clearly data mode mode. right side histogram stretches right mode left. Therefore, body mass data right-skewed. longer “tail” right. opposite, left-skewed. common beginning students confuse two terms. aware concerned mode . want know side data spread longer tail. direction skewness.Outliers.Outliers data points far bulk data. body mass data appears outliers. looking large gap main “mass” data lingering data points far away mass. large gap histogram .Whenever asked “shape” numerical variable, sure comment (1) modes, (2) symmetry, (3) outliers.Generally, default binning ggplot histograms great. design. creator gglot2 package, Hadley Wickham, said following:“ggplot2, simple heuristic used default number bins: uses 30, regardless data. perverse, ignores research selecting good bin sizes automatically, sends clear message user needs think , experiment , bin width. message reinforced warning reminds user manually adjust bin width.”Indeed, look output graphing command , can see ggplot informs pick better value binwidth. can also see bins aren’t ideal. narrow, means arbitrary differences bins show “random” spikes graph. spikes can confuse issue many modes appear data.Instead, aim use bins show overall shape data smooth bit.
