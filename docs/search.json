Generally, look three things:ModesModes peaks data. places data tends cluster, representing common values numerical variable. penguin data, appears big mode 3500 4000 grams. data one clear mode, call data unimodal. data can also bimodal, generally, multimodal. often happens data contains multiple groups different . case, know three species penguin data, species drastically different body mass, might looking multimodal data. ’ll explore question later chapter. now, ’s hard say ’s going histogram lot spiky bars popping . ’s completely obvious many modes might .SymmetryIf one mode, can also ask data spread evenly left right mode. , call data symmetric. data perfectly symmetric, looking overall balance areas left right mode. data symmetric, call skewed. Assuming one big mode around 3500 4000, body mass data skewed. clearly data mode mode. right side histogram stretches right mode left. Therefore, body mass data right-skewed. longer “tail” right. opposite, left-skewed. common beginning students confuse two terms. aware concerned mode . want know side data spread longer tail. direction skewness.Outliers.Outliers data points far bulk data. body mass data appears outliers. looking large gap main “mass” data lingering data points far away mass. large gap histogram .Whenever asked “shape” numerical variable, sure comment (1) modes, (2) symmetry, (3) outliers.Generally, default binning ggplot histograms great. design. creator gglot2 package, Hadley Wickham, said following:“ggplot2, simple heuristic used default number bins: uses 30, regardless data. perverse, ignores research selecting good bin sizes automatically, sends clear message user needs think , experiment , bin width. message reinforced warning reminds user manually adjust bin width.”Indeed, look output graphing command , can see ggplot informs pick better value binwidth. can also see bins aren’t ideal. narrow, means arbitrary differences bins show “random” spikes graph. spikes can confuse issue many modes appear data.Instead, aim use bins show overall shape data smooth bit. Look back scale x-axis assess wide bar . ’s one correct answer. case, bins little wider. Since x-axis goes 2500 6500, maybe try binwidth 250. 250 doesn’t look good, nothing prevents us trying different number.’s also easier interpret histogram bins’ edges line numbers easy see plot. Use boundary determine want bin boundaries fall. example, set boundary 3500, means one bar start left edge 3500. convenient tick mark labeled x-axis. boundary number pretty arbitrary; one boundary set, determines bins line . binwidth 250, ’d get graph boundary set 3000 3250 5750, even 0. multiple 250 give graph.use binwidth boundary inside parentheses geom_histogram modify parameters.Even smoother look, appears multiple modes, maybe three? correspond three species penguin?
