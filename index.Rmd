# Introduction {-#intro}

Welcome to statistics!

If you want, you can also download this book as a <a href="https://vectorposse.github.io/intro_stats/intro_stats.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a> or <a href="https://vectorposse.github.io/intro_stats/intro_stats.epub" target="_blank">EPUB</a> file. Be aware that the print versions are missing some of the richer formatting of the online version. Besides, the recommended way to work through this material is to download the R notebook file (`.Rmd`) at the top of each chapter and work through it in RStudio.
